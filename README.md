</div>

### Description

ALang is an easy to learn and use Assembly Language for beginners. ALang is very close to Assembly language in its syntax and execution. It is an interpreted language. This means that programs written in ALang are not compiled directly into machine codes rather they are executed one by one. It is a very sophisticated language which can execute variety of programs. You can implement loops, conditionals, variables, etc. in this language. As this is its first release it may be having several limitations and bugs. Any comments, improvements, VOTES and feedback will be appreciated.
